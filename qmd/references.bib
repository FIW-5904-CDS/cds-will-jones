   abstract = {identified public roads ranging from interstate highways to four-wheel drive vehicular trails. We used national maps of 2108 watersheds (USGS 1999) and 164 ecore-gions (Bailey 1995) to summarize the measurements that were made on the road and land-cover maps. The road map was converted to a grid format with 0.09 ha per pixel spatial resolution; a given 30-m grid cell was considered a "road" cell if it contained at least one road segment of any class. We converted the gridded road map to a set of nine road proximity maps by placing square windows around each grid cell. Nine window sizes from 1 x 1 to 243 x 243 cells were used. For each window size, a cell value on a road proximity map recorded whether the window of the given size contained at least one "road" cell. The nine road proximity maps were then combined into a single road distance grid, in which each cell recorded the smallest window size that contained a road. It is a road-distance grid because the size of the smallest window that contains a road defines the maximum distance the grid cell can be from the nearest road. We conservatively measured the distance from the outside corner of a grid cell in the corner of a window to the opposite corner of the grid cell in the center of the window. (A less conservative measurement between the centers of the two cells would be 42.4 m less for all window sizes.) Data summaries were prepared by overlaying the road-distance grid with the land-cover, watershed, and ecoregion maps and tabulating the road distances by land-cover type, watershed, or ecoregion. A total of ~8.6 x 10 9 grid cells, including ~2.8 x 10 9 forest land cells, were used in the analysis. Results Approximately 4.5% of the grid cells contained at least one road, and the proportion of total land area that was 126 www.frontiersinecology.org Figure 1. The proportion of total area located within a certain distance from the nearest road increases rapidly with distance. These statistics for the conterminous US were compiled by evaluating road proximity to approximately 8.6 billion locations. Inset: window sizes and corresponding distances used in the analysis. Figure 2. The proportion of total area in a watershed that is within 382 m of the nearest road exhibits substantial geographic variation. Inset: Watersheds where roads are closer to forest land, in comparison to all land-cover types. States are shown for geographic reference.},

   abstract = {We propose a new nonparametric test for equality of two or more multivariate distributions based on Euclidean distance between sample elements. Several consistent tests for comparing multivariate distributions can be developed from the underlying theoretical results. The test procedure for the multisample problem is developed and applied for testing the composite hypothesis of equal distributions, when distributions are unspecified. The proposed test is universally consistent against all fixed alternatives (not necessarily continuous) with finite second moments. The test is implemented by conditioning on the pooled sample to obtain an approximate permutation test, which is distribution free. Our Monte Carlo power study suggests that the new test may be much more sensitive than tests based on nearest neighbors against several classes of alternatives, and performs particularly well in high dimension. Computational complexity of our test procedure is independent of dimension and number of populations sampled. The test is applied in a high dimensional problem, testing microarray data from cancer samples.},

To fill this gap in our knowledge, we collected stream macro-invertebrates from road crossings (bridges and culverts) and compared their diversity with upstream and downstream sections. We found that road crossings had negative effects on the richness and abundance of native macro-invertebrates, as well as on the number of protected taxa. Our results showed also that alien individuals were more abundant at road crossings. These findings support the assumption that road crossings contribute to the spread of alien species. The assessment of environmental variables indicated that road crossings caused habitat modifications, and based on these it can be assumed that habitat modifications and associated phenomena (e.g. pollutants and storm events) were the major drivers of the observed patterns in biodiversity. Our results fill a knowledge gap and contribute to the deeper understanding of the effect of road crossings on freshwater biodiversity.},

A major proportion of wetland biodiversity is composed of aquatic invertebrates, which are essential for secondary production in aquatic and terrestrial food webs. Urban areas have intensified the challenges wetlands encounter by increasing the area of impermeable surfaces and the levels of nutrient and pollutant overflows. We investigated how urban infrastructure affects the aquatic invertebrate fauna of urban wetlands in metropolitan Helsinki, southern Finland. We measured riparian canopy cover, emergent vegetation coverage, and various land cover and road variables. Recreation area, forests, and open natural areas were the most important landscape features positively influencing aquatic invertebrate family richness, whereas buildings and roads had a negative effect on family richness and abundances of many taxa. Recreation area and the various forest types also positively affected the α-diversity indices of wetlands. On the other hand, fish assemblage did not affect either family richness or abundances of the studied taxa. Furthermore, trees growing on the shoreline negatively affected the diversity of aquatic invertebrate families. Invertebrate family diversity was greatest at well-connected wetlands, as these areas added to the regional species pool by over 33%. Our results show that connectivity and green areas near wetlands increase aquatic invertebrate family diversity, and our results could be utilized in urban planning.},

   abstract = {Major roads have become significant components of environmental change but their impacts on invertebrate assemblages are insufficiently understood, and therefore rarely considered in road-planning and management. In the current study, we test (i) whether and how orthopteran assemblages change with distance from a motorway, and (ii) how road-induced changes in noise level, vegetation height and microclimate affect assemblage metrics and spatial distribution of orthopteran species. In 2018, we sampled orthopterans at five distances from a motorway: 10, 25, 50, 100 and 500 m, in eight locations within homogeneous portions of a grassland habitat in Lika region, Croatia, using two sampling methods: pitfall trapping and sweep-netting. Orthopteran abundance, species richness, true diversity and conservation value decreased at the sites closest to the motorway in the pitfall dataset, primarily due to negative responses of species with low-frequency acoustic signals. Road-influenced vegetation height had a stronger overall impact on orthopteran assemblages than traffic noise and/or microclimate; increased diversity and conservation value at 25 m from the motorway suggest an effect similar to early stages of vegetation succession. This study shows, for the first time, that a major road can induce changes in adjacent orthopteran assemblages, but negative impacts are confined to a narrow zone. Our results indicate that road-induced changes in orthopteran assemblages could be more efficiently assessed using pitfall trapping than sweep-netting. Increasing heterogeneity of roadside habitats by appropriate vegetation management could help mitigating negative road impacts on Orthoptera in the study area, while contributing to higher diversity of their assemblages.},

   abstract = {1.The effect of a road upon heathland vegetation was investigated at five sites adjacent to the main trunk road through the New Forest, Hampshire, UK, with nine supplementary sites adjacent to five minor roads. 2. There was enhanced growth of vascular plants, notably heather and grass species near the road, which was probably due to oxides of nitrogen from vehicle exhausts. There was a decrease in the abundance and health of lichens near the road. 3. There was an increase in the abundance of grasses in the heathland near roads, which may be due to the changes in relative competitive ability of plant species under conditions of eutrophication. 4. The extent of the edge effect in the heath was closely correlated with the amount of traffic carried by the road, with a maximum edge effect of 200 m adjacent to a dual carriageway. This should be taken into account when considering the environmental impact of new roads. Road widening with its associated increase in traffic can also be expected to impact on existing oligotrophic communities beyond the actual land-take. Such schemes should include buffer zones to protect oligotrophic communities or other measures to minimize the pollution input from vehicle exhausts to environ- mentally sensitive areas.},

   abstract = {Roads and traffic may be contributing to global declines of insect populations. The ecological effects of roads often extend far into the surrounding habitat, over a distance known as the road-effect zone. The quality of habitat in the road-effect zone is generally degraded (e.g., due to edge effects, noise, light, and chemical pollution) and can be reflected in species presence, abundance, or demographic parameters. Road-effect zones have been quantified for some vertebrate species but are yet to be quantified for insects. Investigating the road-effect zone for insects will provide a better understanding of how roads impact ecosystems, which is particularly important given the role insects play as pollinators, predators, and prey for other species. We quantified the road-effect zone for nocturnal flying insects along three major freeways in agricultural landscapes in southeast Australia. We collected insects using light traps at six points along 2-km transects perpendicular to each highway (n = 17). We sorted the samples into order, and dried and weighed each order to obtain a measure of dry biomass. Using regression models within a Bayesian framework of inference, we estimated the change in biomass of each order with distance from the road, while accounting for environmental variables such as temperature, moon phase, and vegetation structure. The biomass of nine of the ten orders sampled did not change with distance from the freeway. Orthoptera (i.e., grasshoppers and crickets) was the only order whose biomass increased with distance from the freeway. From our findings, we suggest that the impacts of roads on insects are unlikely extending into the surrounding landscape over a distance of 2 km. Therefore, if there are impacts of roads on insects, these are more likely to be concentrated at the road itself, or on finer taxonomic scales such as family or genus level.},

   abstract = {Roads now penetrate even the most remote parts of much of the world, but the majority of research on the effects of roads on biota has been in less remote temperate environments. The impacts of roads in semi-arid and arid areas may differ from these results in a number of ways. Here, we review the research on the impacts of roads on biodiversity patterns and ecological and evolutionary processes in semi-arid regions. The most obvious effect of roads is mortality or injury through collision. A diversity of scavengers are killed whilst feeding on roadkill, a source of easily accessed food. Noise pollution from roads and traffic interferes with vocal communication by animals, and birds and frogs living along noisy roads compensate for traffic noise by increasing the amplitude or pitch of their calls. Artificial light along roads impacts certain species' ability to navigate, as well as attracting invertebrates. Animals are in turn attracted to invertebrates at streetlights, and vulnerable to becoming roadkill themselves. Genetics research across taxa confirms a loss of genetic diversity in small populations isolated by roads, but the long-term impact on the fitness of affected populations through a reduction in genetic diversity is not yet clear. Roads may rapidly cause genetic effects, raising conservation concerns about rare and threatened species. We assess mitigation measures and collate methods to identify the impact of roads on wildlife populations and their associated ecosystems, with a particular focus on recent advances.},

   abstract = {We analyzed one of the inseparable components of road landscapes of Ukraine, their ecozones. As noted, road landscapes are divided into three categories: road landscape-en- gineer systems (RLESs), road landscape-technogenic systems (RLTSs) and road landscapes proper (RLP). Depending on those categories of road landscapes, there form respective road ecozones. Most distinctively, they become structured and developed over the process of constructing and functioning of RLESs. Therefore, the objectives of our research were the structure, typology, properties and significance of ecozones, mostly those of road landscape-engineer systems for the purpose of their rational exploitation. The objects of the research were RLESs of Ternopil-Khemel- nytskyi-Vinnytsia-Uman-Kropyvnytskyi (M-12) and Kyiv-Odesa (M-5). The research was carried out using the basic principles of landscape science – emergence, cause and effect relationships, history, comparability; methods of analysis, synthesis, modeling, map- ping, GIS-technologies using the software: graphic editors CorelDRAW and Adobe Photoshop, and also open-source network of satellite images Google Earth and other. The notion of road ecozone is considered as a complex ecological structure that is formed and developed over the process of functioning of road landscapes. In more details, we have analyzed the ecozones of modern road landscape-engineer systems M-12 and M-5 which have long been actively operating. Field landscape-science-oriented and ecological studies of ecozones of those RLESs over the period of 2019-2021 made it possible to distinguish and substantiate ten microecozones in their structure. Their specific features are conditioned by specifics of the structure and ecologic condition of previous landscape complexes – the fundamentals of modern RLESs; spatial-temporal specifics of the formation; «linear» spread; dependence on the func- tioning of one type of transport (automobile) and purpose. The features of microecozones are conditioned by land allocated to roads, technical impact, chemical contamination, contamination of soil, aquatic and air contaminations, acoustic and lighting impacts, and esthetic and landscape contaminations. Over the process of further studies, it is possible to distinguish other microecozones, specifically those of biotic and geological impacts, and also uniting certain microecozones into groups. We analyzed one of typical features of road ecozones – their asymmetry. We distinguished and characterized three types of asymmetry of road ecozones – wind-caused, orographic and landscape asymmetries. Not always do their vectors of development coincide. We should note that over the process of functioning of RLTSs and SRLs, there also develop roadside ecozones with respective set of microecozones, though they need additional studies. Further study of ecozones in road landscapes would allow for more thorough planning and forming of their structure, functioning, im- pact on human health and environment. Road landscapes of any category need to be re-constructed into a system of complex purpose – transport, scientific, recreational and esthetic.},

   abstract = {A general method for constructing permutation tests for various experimental designs follows from invariance and sufficiency. In this framework, randomization (or rerandomization) tests are just special cases of permutation tests. The methodology extends the applicability of permutation tests: An example demonstrates a test for an interaction effect in a factorial experiment, a problem thought to be unapproachable by permutation or randomization methods. Tests are constructed as follows. The modeling of block and treatment effects closely parallels classical analysis of variance (ANOVA). The ANOVA assumptions of iid normal random errors are replaced, however, by the much weaker assumption of exchangeability of subsets of random errors. Distributional dependences on the unknown nuisance parameters for blocks, covariates, and untested treatments and on the unknown error distribution are eliminated by invariance and sufficiency, respectively. Initial reduction of the data by invariance appears to extend considerably the applicability of permutation tests. Because of the assumed exchangeability of the errors, the sufficiency step leads to data permutations when computing the test. The method also addresses some philosophical problems associated with randomization tests. For instance, in this article’s framework, it is the design, and not the data, which is always regarded as fixed, so ancillarity of the design causes no difficulty. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

   abstract = {Transportation infrastructure has a wide range of effects on ecological processes, which result in both positive and negative impacts for biodiversity. However, the treatment of biodiversity in planning and environmental assessment have been criticized, especially regarding habitat loss and fragmentation effects, the low use of quantitative methods and that of assessments being descriptive rather than analytical and predictive. The aim of this study was to assess the impacts of the Swedish road network by spatial modelling of road effects, to explore potential impacts of fragmentation and disturbance effects of roads on habitat networks for selected ecological profiles, and to discuss the utility of applying quantitative methods for environmental assessment purposes. Habitat and landcover data was used for creating habitat networks for six ecological profiles. Fragmentation and disturbance effects were modelled in GIS and FRAGSTATS was used to quantify ecologically important landscape metrics on habitat amount and connectivity. The results showed that natural grasslands and southern broadleaved forest were substantially more exposed to road effects in Sweden, compared to old coniferous and trivial broadleaved forest. Furthermore, habitat loss was a main consequence of road effects, and forest species with high area demands were most prone to be adversely impacted. Suggestions on method development in order to increase the quality of the analysis methods for environmental assessment are discussed. The potential is seen as high for use of quantitative ecological methods to generate baseline environmental information as well as coarse predictions on likely consequences of development options, useful for environmental assessment.},

The relationship between LER and accessibility factors (distance to different road-types and road kernel density) and topographical factors (elevation and slope) were explored using ordinary least square (OLS) regression and geographically weighted regression (GWR) model. Our results indicate that high-risk LER zones are closer to the road network. This is also in conjunction with increasing built-up areas adjacent to the road network. Regression analysis using GWR model better explained the relationship between LER (dependent variable) and distance from different road-types (independent variables) as compared to OLS with a significant correlation at 1% confidence interval. The spatial variations in the interrelation between dependent and independent variables were explained using quantified coefficients estimated by the GWR model. The estimation and visualization of spatial associations between landscape structure, LER, and road network provided in our study can act as a baseline for developing a guideline for sustainable infrastructure development and management of ecologically vulnerable landscapes across the tropical world.},

They have gained rapid popularity and provided significant conceptual improvements for decision making in conservation planning. We present a further methodological development of the habitat availability concept and metrics by partitioning them into three separate fractions that quantify the different ways in which individual landscape elements can contribute to overall habitat connectivity and availability in the landscape, including stepping stone effects. These fractions are derived from the same concept, are measured in the same units and can be directly compared and combined within a unifying framework. This avoids the problematic and, so far, usual combination of metrics coming from different backgrounds and the arbitrary weighting of connectivity considerations in a broader context of conservation alternatives. We analyse how the relative importance of each fraction varies with species traits. In addition, we show how the critical patches differ for each of the fractions by analysing various forest habitats in the province of Lleida (NE Spain). We discuss the conceptual and conservation implications of this approach, which can be adapted to different degrees of ecological and spatial detail within the graph while still maintaining a coherent framework for the identification of critical elements in the landscape network. © 2010 The Authors.},

   abstract = {A huge road network with vehicles ramifies across the land, representing a surprising frontier of ecology. Species-rich roadsides are conduits for few species. Roadkills are a premier mortality source, yet except for local spots, rates rarely limit population size. Road avoidance, especially due to traffic noise, has a greater ecological impact. The still-more-important barrier effect subdivides populations, with demographic and probably genetic consequences. Road networks crossing landscapes cause local hydrologic and erosion effects, whereas stream networks and distant valleys receive major peak-flow and sediment impacts. Chemical effects mainly occur near roads. Road networks interrupt horizontal ecological flows, alter landscape spatial pattern, and therefore inhibit important interior species. Thus, road density and network structure are informative landscape ecology assays. Australia has huge road-reserve networks of native vegetation, whereas the Dutch have tunnels and overpasses perforating road barriers to enhance ecological flows. Based on road-effect zones, an estimated 15-20% of the United States is ecologically impacted by roads.},

   abstract = {1. Roads can act as barriers to animal movement, which may reduce population persistence by reducing recolonization of empty habitats and limiting immigration. Appropriate mitigation of this barrier effect (e.g. seasonal road closures, location and design of wildlife over- or underpasses) depends upon whether the animals avoid the road itself or the traffic on the road. Empirical studies of road avoidance to date do not generally differentiate between these. 2. We conducted short- and long-distance translocations and trapping studies of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) near two-lane paved roads, which differed widely in traffic amount, from 47 to 15 433 vehicles per day. 3. In the trapping study (13 sites) only five animals moved across a road, in comparison to 36 animals that moved the same distance without an intervening road (P < 0.0001). In the short-distance translocations (15 sites), 51% of the small mammals that were translocated across roads returned, in comparison to a return rate of 77% of animals that were translocated a similar distance with no intervening road (P = 0.009). 4. In the long-distance translocation study (24 sites) we found that each intervening road reduced the probability of successful return by about 50%. 5. We found no significant effects of traffic amount on return rates in either the short-distance or the long-distance translocations studies. 6. Small mammal densities were not lower near roads and we found no evidence for a decrease in density near roads with increasing traffic amount. 7. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that small mammals avoid the road itself, and not emissions such as noise from the traffic on the roads. Our results imply that the barrier effect of roads on these species cannot be mitigated by measures aimed at reducing traffic amount; other measures such as wildlife passages would be needed. © 2007 The Authors.},

   abstract = {Road networks can have serious ecological consequences for many species, mainly through habitat fragmentation and mortality due to collisions with vehicles. One example of a species impacted by roads is the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), currently listed as Vulnerable by IUCN. Here we analysed the relative effect of fragmentation and mortality due to roads on giant anteater populations and show the critical areas for their persistence in Brazil. We estimated minimum patch size and maximum road density to evaluate the impact of the road network and observed road-kills on this species. We explored different scenarios by varying values of dispersal capacity to estimate the minimum patch size, and also of population densities to estimate maximum road density for giant anteater persistence. Our findings indicated that the minimum patch size can be from 498 to 247 km2 and the maximum road density can vary between 0.21 and 0.55 km/km2 in pessimist and optimistic scenarios, respectively. In Brazil, habitat fragmentation seemed to have a major impact over giant anteater populations. Habitat fragmentation due to roads seemed to have a more negative effect than mortality due to collisions with vehicles. Critical areas for the species persistence can represent 32% of its range in the optimistic scenario with 18% of suitable patches below the minimum size and 0.1% above the maximum road density. This study provides insights and implications for road networks on giant anteater populations in Brazil and guidance on road density and patch size thresholds for land managers and road agencies charged with planning ecologically sustainable roads in Brazil.},
