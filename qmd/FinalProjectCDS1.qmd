# Abstract

The 2003 study "How Far to the Nearest Road ?" published in *Frontiers in Ecology and The Environment* studied the road network of the United States [@riitters.etal.2003]. Specifically, it split the contiguous US into 30x30 m grid cells and classified each as being a "road" or "non-road" cell, based on if any part of the cell intersects a TIGER/line road feature. Then, a binned classification was used to measure the distance of every cell to its nearest road cell.

Our aim is to expand on this methodology using GIS and statistical methods. Specifically, our objective is to answer the following questions:

1.  By randomly sampling points and calculating straight-line (Euclidean) distances, can we measure a more accurate continuous distribution of distance to the nearest road?
2.  Using archived Census Bureau TIGER/Line geographic data, can we measure how far the average distance to the nearest road has changed in the contiguous US?
3.  What water bodies have experienced the greatest change and become more vulnerable to ecological effects of road construction and operation?

# Introduction

There are well-documented effects of roads on habitat fragmentation \[CITE\], plant health \[CITE\], and species diversity \[CITE\]. Native stream invertebrate species may be especially at risk. In fact, Gál, et al. found that road crossings had negative effects on the biodiversity of native invertebrates in Hungary, including species richness, abundance, and prevalence of protected species [@blanka.etal.2020]. Between X and X year, Y miles of roads have been built, an average of X miles of road per year \[CITE\]. Of course, this period encompasses the time since the last contiguous United States-level measurement of distances to the nearest road in 2003 [@riitters.etal.2003]. Using GIS methods and a statistical approach based on the energy distance [@szekely.gabor.2004], we may examine the expansion of the United States road network for future ecological applications. Additionally, through measurement of a paired continuous distribution of distances (2000 and 2024), we may observe the magnitude of change in distances, both at the national scale, and at relevant sub-levels, including watershed, EPA ecoregion, NLCD landcover class, and even individual stream level.

# Methods

## Data Acquisition and Preprocessing

Six primary spatial datasets were used in our analysis. The 2023 USGS National Land Cover Database (NLCD), containing 11 distinct land cover classes, was used to extract surface type at each of our sampled points [@usgs]. Likewise, attribute data for each sampled point was extracted using the EPA’s ecoregion level IV map, and watershed membership was extracted using the USGS 3D Hydrography Program (3DHP) data set. 3DHP is a unified lidar-derived data product containing vector data for streams, lakes, ponds, catchments, and other hydrologic features (USGS, 2025).

US Census Bureau’s TIGER/Line vector files were used as the road networks in this project. The most recently available 2024 road network data for the conterminous United States was downloaded in bulk using the roads() function from the Python package pygris [@pygris].

Comparable data for the year 2000 was downloaded from the archived Census FTP site (<https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/tiger2k/),> and a multi- step data preprocessing workflow was performed before the data was implemented in the analysis workflow. First, beautifulsoup4 was used to download vector dataset in RT1 format, the historical file format for census geographic data [@beautifulsoup]. Using GDAL command-line utilities, files were converted to modern shapefile format, then merged into a single dataset using geopandas in python [@geopandas]. Finally, feature correction was performed using geometry-snapping and densification processing in QGIS 3.36 ”Maidenhead.” To rectify data quality issues, namely feature accuracy and spatial mismatch between existing roads in the 2000 and 2024 datasets, the historical vector dataset was densified at regular 25m intervals, then snapped to the nearest matching feature in the current roads dataset. This was done to avoid erroneous measurement differences in distance to the nearest road for each year that may be incorrectly attributed to removal or addition of a new road feature [@t2024].

## Sampling Scheme and Measurement

### Terrestrial Points

Using the R package sf, 1,000,000 points were randomly sampled across our study area (Virginia, USA). Points were sampled uniformly across space, meaning that everywhere on the continuous surface has equal likelihood of being sampled (Fotheringham and Rogereson 2008). Next, the nearest feature from each road network (2000 and 2024) was identified for each randomly sampled point, and the Euclidean distance between the two geometries was measured. The result was two continuous distributions, each containing a measurement at the same point. This is a case of paired data, analogous to 'before and after' measurements.

### Water Points

To perform the corresponding process for water features (lakes, ponds, streams, creeks), a slightly different sampling method was used. It is our goal to randomly select points along linear water features and along the *edges* of waterbodies (polygons). We do not want to sample points within ponds or lakes, because the measurement of interest is the distance between the least central points of each areal feature (i.e., the "shore") and the nearest road feature. This effectively captures where ecological interactions such as runoff into ponds/lakes will occur. To do this, the layers `hydro_3dhp_all_flowline` and `hydro_3dhp_all_waterbody` were extracted from the USGS 3DHP geodatabase, representing flowlines and waterbodies, respectively. Due to the structure of the 3DHP features, `flowlines` are often drawn through the waterbody that they feed into. To navigate this, and avoid sampling within water bodies, the `sf` package function `st_difference` was used to eliminate these overlapping flowlines from the features that could be sampled on. Lastly, lake and pond boundaries were merged with stream and river features into a single linear feature layer. When using `st_sample`, this ensures that the points are uniformly randomly sampled, meaning that any point in our dataset has equal probability of being sampled.

## Statistical Analysis

For the purposes of this class project, 100,000 of the \~1e6 points were chosen randomly for analysis in order to make local processing possible.

To compare the shift in distributions from 2000 to 2024, a permutation test for matched pairs was used [@welch.1990], along with bootstrap resampling [@dixon.2001] to construct a confidence interval for the test statistic of interest, the mean of the differences between the paired points. The mean of the paired differences was chosen as the test statistic for analysis because the data set is dominated by points whose values did not change (i.e., difference is 0).This characteristic of the distribution, along with the fact that the distribution of differences is not symmetric around the mean (see @fig-qq), is why we did not use the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test.

![](ProjectFigures/differences_qq.png){#fig-qq}

We used bootstrapping [@dixon.2001] to construct a sampling distribution and confidence interval for the mean of paired differences. The observed mean of the differences between our paired data is 74.89 meters. After bootstrap resampling, we have a theoretical sampling distribution with a mean of 74.87 meters (95% CI: (73.19, 76.60)) and a standard error of 0.87 meters.

![](ProjectFigures/bootstrap_hist.png)

### Permutation Test

Then we performed a permutation test for paired data [@matched.perm] to test for significance in our results:

``` r
results = c()
for (i in 1:5000) {
  permutedData = sample(c(1,-1),100000,replace=T)*dat$difference
  results = c(mean(permutedData),results)
}
hist(results,col='gray',main="Permutation Distribution",xlab="Simulated difference")
mean(results)
results <- as.data.frame(results)
```

For the standard case of a permutation test, the null hypothesis is that the two groups of interest come from the *same distribution*, and the alternative hypothesis is that the groups are not from the same distribution. In the case of the matched-pairs permutation test, our hypotheses are:

$$
\Large
H_0: \mu_{\text{diff}} = 0  
$$

In other words, the difference in the before and after values of points is due to random chance

$$
\Large
H_a: \mu_{\text{diff}} \neq 0
$$

The permutation test computes 5,000 permutations of the 100,000 paired points, where before/after values are switched. At each permutation, the test statistic (the mean of all the paired differences) is computed. This creates a roughly normal distribution of mean values. This works on the assumption that if there truly is no difference in the distributions of the before and after groups. Under the null assumption, the observed test statistic (74.89 m, which we calculated from our original sample), should fall somewhere within the "null" or permutation distribution. To calculate our p-value, we take the proportion of all permutation values that are equal to or more extreme than our test statistic. @fig-permHist shows clearly that the test statistic obtained from our sample (red line) is far more extreme than what can be expected if there is no difference in the values of before/after groups.
